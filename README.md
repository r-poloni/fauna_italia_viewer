# Webiste to view Checklist of Italian Fauna Online (family Oedemeridae)

This page provides the code for a website that allows to view the data for the Checklist of Italian Fauna (https://www.lifewatchitaly.eu/en/initiatives/checklist-fauna-italia-en/checklist/) in an interactive way.

The website is currently hosted as a github page and is currently containing only the family Oedemeridae, for which I curated the Italian checklist: https://r-poloni.github.io/fauna_italia_viewer/
